This is a small compilation of material and examples for getting started with the MESA/Binary module.

RGB_overflow_example is an example run that is ready to go. Simply executed it (./clean, ./mk, ./rn) like you would with any other MESA run. See the README file in the RGB_overflow_example directory for more information about the run and a walkthrough of its evolution.

The MESA_SS14_labs directory contains the lab materials and instructions for Lars Bildsten's binary mass transfer lab from the 2014 MESA Summer School. Each lab has its own instructional PDF, and the presentation powerpoint is also included. Use the instructions and the lecture slides to work through the labs. The labs are more in-depth and advanced, but if you can work your way through them you'll certainly be in good shape for moving forward with the binary module! The labs must be done in order (the "maxilab" or the bigger lab builds off of the "minilab", so do the minilab first).

Just like MESA/star, if there are any new inlist commands that you are unfamiliar with when using MESA/binary (though most are pretty self explanatory), check out the MESA/binary/defaults directory!
